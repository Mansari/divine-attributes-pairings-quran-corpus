        "\n",
        "My fascination with the pairings of Allah SWT's beautiful names in the Quran has driven me to delve deeper into their significance. Consider, for instance, the pairing of السميع العليم (As-Sami' Al-Alim) in Surat An-Nisa, Aya 220 ([26:220](https://quran.com/26/220)). What profound insights might we glean from the deliberate coupling of these specific names by Allah SWT? This notebook documents my journey to programmatically identify and analyze these pairings.\n",
